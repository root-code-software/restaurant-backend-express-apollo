            <p>
            As part of your onboarding, Cookinat will conduct a criminal background check with your consent. Potential U.S. Cooks must provide a valid social security number in order to undergo the criminal background check, which is conducted by a third-party company, Checkr, Inc.
            The background check searches national and county-level databases, as well as local courthouse records, for convictions throughout your adult life.[2] This check also searches the United States Department of Justice Sex Offender Registry and the Federal Criminal Records database.
        
            The results of the background check are reviewed by Cookinat and assessed against applicable regulations and Cookinat’s internal safety criteria. You may be ineligible to drive on the Cookinat platform if, at the time of your application, your background check results reveal that you:
          
            Are listed on the National Sex Offender Registry database;
            
            Have been convicted at any time of a disqualifying violent crime (such as homicide, kidnapping, human trafficking, arson, burglary, carjacking, robbery, or aggravated assault);
         
            Have been convicted at any time of a sexual offense (such as rape, sexual assault, or child pornography);
          
            Have been convicted at any time of an act of terror;
           
            Have been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in the past seven years, or longer in some jurisdictions;
            
            Have been convicted of a disqualifying fraud-related offense in the past seven years for most jurisdictions, although this time frame may be longer, or shorter, in certain jurisdictions;
            
            Have been convicted of a disqualifying drug-related offense in the past seven years for most jurisdictions, although this time frame may be longer, or shorter, in certain jurisdictions;
         
            Have been convicted of a disqualifying theft or property damage offense in the past seven years for most jurisdictions, although this time frame may be longer, or shorter, in certain jurisdictions.
           
            Please be aware that laws governing disqualifying convictions vary significantly by jurisdiction, and the above list is not inclusive of all disqualifying convictions. You may be found ineligible to drive for Lyft based on other types of records.

            Cookinat requires an up-to-date background check to remain on the platform. If you are returning to the platform after a period of inactivity, please contact us to ensure that your profile is current.
           
            Please be aware that in New York City, DMV and criminal background checks are conducted by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) according to their licensing standards, not by Cookinat.
           
            Lyft reserves the right to disqualify a Cook at any time, in compliance with applicable law, should their background check reveal any disqualifying offense or for any other safety-related reason.
         
            If your background check reveals potentially disqualifying information, you will receive a copy of the report via email along with instructions on how to dispute the results. Keep in mind that background checks may take several weeks to process.

            [2] Certain states may restrict access to criminal records older than 7 years.

          <button class="accordion"><h4>Background check FAQs</h4></button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                Typically, background check results will be available within 2 - 4 days. However, searches at the county level are subject to the availability of records from county courthouses. Some of these courts lack electronic records access or are understaffed, which can cause background checks to take several weeks to complete. You can check the status of your background check by logging in to the Checkr applicant portal.
                
                2. I received a copy of my background check, but it is incorrect. I was not charged with the offense listed, or there is something inaccurate or incomplete about the information in the report. What should I do?

                If you believe that the contents of your background check are inaccurate or incomplete, you may contact Checkr, Inc. (the company that provided the background check to Lyft) directly by phone at 844-824-3257 or by using the Checkr applicant portal.

                Please note that there is no time limit on when you can dispute the accuracy of your report with Checkr, but we encourage you to do so as soon as possible.

                3. I received a copy of my background check, and it is accurate. However, I believe there was an error. I do not believe I should be disqualified from driving for Cookinat based on my criminal history. What should I do?
                If the information contained in your background check is correct, but you believe that you were disqualified in error, contact Cookinat support directly

                4. It seems like Cookinat’s background check criteria may vary by region. Why?
                State and local laws vary significantly. Some jurisdictions require Cookinat to disqualify applicants with certain records, while others do not require disqualification for those same records. To comply with applicable laws, the criteria Cookinat uses to evaluate an applicant’s criminal history often varies by jurisdiction.

                5. I have applied to provide services on several “gig economy” platforms. My background check passed for those companies, but I was disqualified from driving for Lyft based on my criminal history. Why?
                
                Laws governing “gig economy” companies may vary depending on the type of service being provided. Also, keep in mind that potential drivers’ background checks must comply with Cookinat’s internal safety standards, which may be more strict than regulatory standards or the criteria of other platforms.
                
                6. I have been Cook for Cookinat but I was notified that I need to pass another background check to keep driving. Why? I already passed a background check when I initially applied.

                Cookinat conducts background checks routinely on all active drivers to ensure continued compliance with applicable laws and safety regulations. Lyft may also conduct an additional background check if you move from one driving region to another.

                7. I have been Cook for Cookinat for several years and have passed two background checks in that time. After my most recent background check was run, I was notified that I have been deactivated because of the criminal history contained in my background check. I do not have any recent convictions, and the only conviction I have is from many, many years ago. Why did this happen and what should I do?

                This result may have occurred for several reasons. For example, some state and local laws restrict how far back a conviction can be reported to us. If you have recently moved from one of these jurisdictions to a state with no reporting restrictions, an older disqualifying offense may have surfaced in your background check. We understand how frustrating this can be. If you have been cooking for Cookinat and are subsequently deactivated for an offense that occurred prior to your initial application, please contact Cookinat directly and provide us with more information.
                
                8. I am unable to access the Cookinat platform due to my background check. Why?
                This may have occurred for several reasons. Your background check may have resulted in an error, or it may require further action. Please contact us to find out more.

                9. My ID Validation failed. Why? What does this mean?
                All Social Security Numbers (SSN) are validated against multiple databases to ensure that the SSN matches the user applying to drive with Lyft.

                10. My background check is ‘suspended’. What does that mean?
                Your background check may require additional action with Checkr. You should have received an email from no-reply@checkr.com with instructions, or you can log-in to the Checkr applicant portal to view your status.

                11. I have been Cook for Cookinat, but now I cannot access Cook mode. I was told that I need to consent to a new background check. How do I do that?
                If you are not receiving a consent pop-up when you log in to the driver app, the disclosure and consent form may be located under the notifications tab in your app.
