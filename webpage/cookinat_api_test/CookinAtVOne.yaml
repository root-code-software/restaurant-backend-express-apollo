    # 🤤🍽👨‍🍳 CookinAt

    Is a platform connecting diners with cooks.
    Upcoming versions may also include similar services such as waiters, catering, cocktails, etc.

    ## 🎉 Welcome to CookinAt API 🎆

    We offer REST endpoints and a GraphQL endpoint so you can run queries. 
    If you are looking for the GraphQL endpoint please visit [the playground](https://www.cookinat.com/graphql).

    ### General User Operations

    * SignUp in App: A user must enter the info needed to create an user. 
        + [Cook](#/Auth/postAuthSignupCook): More info regardless cooking is needed
        + [Diner](#/Auth/postAuthSignupDiner): General info needed, confidential data is not shared nor selled to 3rd parties.

    * [LogIn with the user you created in SignUp step](#/Auth/postAuthLogin) Provide `email` and `password` in order to get an `user_id` and `token` for later requests. 
    
    * [Send a petition to reset Password](#/Auth/getAuthLoginForgot) If the user is unable to enter her/his credentials, an option is shown so the password can be updated. 
    
    * [Verify that you own the email given](#/Auth/postAuthSignupVerification) After the user signup, she/he must enter a code sent to her/his email to activate user.

    ## 🔑 JWT and Access Keys 🔐

    All the APIs are ready to accept normal user and admins/other devs. To normal  users we provide the JWT mechanism, intended to be used in CookinAt App. But special *access keys* are provided for different needs, with different levels of authority. Please note that brute force attacks on access keys with result in insta-banning.

            ### Proposed User SignUp-LogIn-ChooseRole Flow 

            1. User enter the _SignUp View_ and send `name`, `email`, `role` and `password` to Backend 
            
            2. Backend send back  `userId` (for support and `/auth/login/forgot`),  `name` (for UI) and  `email`
            (for UI and `/auth/signup/verification`). 
            
            3. Also Backend send a `verificationCode` to user's
            email. User can request re-send [here]() 
            
            4. User enter the _Verification View_ and enter
            `verificationCode`.  The App must **automatically include email**, and send 
            
            5. Backend answers. 
            If no match, _SignUp Error View_, if match _SignUp Ok View_ 
            
            6. User go to _LogIn View_ and enter
            `email` and `password` 
            
            7. If all ok, user can go to _Home View_. If no match User can go to _Login
            Password Forgot View_. 
            
            8. If User in _Login Password Forgot View_, then send in petition `email` ,
            a  `One Time Password (OTP)` is generated and sent to email given 
            
            9. User can enter _LogIn View_ 
            and enter `OTP` as password to enter and set new `password` in settings, OR 
            
            10. User enter in
            _LogIn View_ and enter normally. 
            
            11. Then after _Login View_ user must enter _Home View_ 
            
            12. ...

            13. Profit!
